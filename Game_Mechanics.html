        <h1>Game Guide</h1>
        <p>Movement of the Player Character: <br>
		The player can move Sael by using the following - To move on the keyboard use either the arrow keys or the WASD keys to move in the desired direction.
		<br>
		To play with your controller you use either the joystick or the arrow keys to move to the side you wished to move to.
		<br>
		On Phones you can use the overlay that will be included for phone users, all on touch controls.</p>
        <p>Interaction with items:<br>
		To interact with an item the player has to be close to it and press either the E button or Enter. <br>
		On Controllers the button needed to be pressed is A.<br>
		On phones the virtual button A should be pressed to be able to interact with the world.</p>
        <p>Sael's Clothing:<br>
		In the game Sael can wear different types of clothing, these are clothing that is unlocked by achievements or progressing the game in general.<br>
		The clothes Sael unlocks are kept in the dresser under the window of her appartment, and these can be put on using the Put on Clothing button and then selecting the outfit preffered.
		<br>
		Note: Unless the player has enabled the Sex toggle on the main menu, the player will not be able to remove Sael's underwear.</p>
        <p>Health & Death System:<br>
		Sael has a set amount of Health that she has, which can be damaged by doing too many interactions with demons in a day. - Normal amount is 3 before taking damage.<br>
		Sael's health can also be damaged by not sleeping for a day. As then her health will be halved, this is due to the Insomnia problem that Sael has where yes she does not need sleep, but her vision will become blurry.<br>
		If Sael dies in a fight with a human or demon, she fades from existence as we know it, she will be falling into the void as her soul is shattered unless she finishes the game.</p>
        <p>Healing & Ressurection:<br>
		Sael can be healed by spending time with her friends, this is done in multiple ways, either you can call your friends to hang out at a restaurant, or at Sael's place.<br>
		If Sael dies and is lost to the void the player will get a choice to either commit suicide -give up- or get resurected -continue- if the player has Sex enabled the player instead can decide to submit to whatever defeated them.</p>
        <p>Sex & Submission:<br>
		Note - Player has to have Sex enabled on the home screen to enable this content, if the player loads a save with Sex enabled while Sex is turned off on the menu this will break the save forever.<br>
		Sael is a woman who dressess sloppily, barely takes care of herself and is known to be cold to people. Some people in the world will take unkindly to her or her behaviour and may decide to knock her out or just rape her on the spot.<br>
		If Sael enters and Alleyway to find loot in any type of container, she has a 30% chance of running into thugs that decide to have a go at her.<br>
		Submission is the system we use for if Sael gets defeated by a person only avaiable in game if the Sex toggle is enabled, she will automatically enter a submissive position to have her life spared. This also halves her life, so if the player has halved her life by not sleeping their life will be a quarter of Sael's normal health.</p>
