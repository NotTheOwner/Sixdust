        <h1>Summary of what is in the game</h1>
				<p>Take a step back from the nice calming game play of RPG's, and step out of your comfort zone with Sixdust, a 2D side-scrolling adventure game where you help people in the world, and where punches are not held back. </p>
        <p>Sael, the protagonist of Sixdust in the nasty city of Nighborough has a secret, the secret is so well-kept within however, that even she does not know the truth anymore. She see's what is really there, hidden in the strings of life, the demons that sow themselves to us, to influence our sins.</p>
        <p>Now Sael is not a Demon Hunter, at the least not in the traditional sense, she hunts the humans whose demons are unable to escape, you see, if a human becomes too infested into a sin, or patterns of the sin the demon starts to melt into the person, agony for both, as the demon will lash out, taking control and harming the host and people around it fo get freed.</p>
